Projects I use to help me learn to code better
Hopefully this will be full of stuff!


Project 1: "Dungeon game"
  This should be a cool dungeon exploring game - I hope to learn how to make random rooms, and potentially create descriptions to match.
  Player movement and interactions will still be limited to basic text commands for now.
