# Projects

Projects I use to help me learn to code better. Hopefully, this will be full of stuff!

## Project 1: "Dungeon game"
Dungeon Game is a text-based adventure game where you explore a randomly generated dungeon, collect items, and try to find the exit. The game features random room generation, item collection, locked doors requiring keys, and clues to help you find the exit phrase. Player movement and interactions are performed using basic text commands.

For more details, see the [Project1 README](./Project1/readme.md).

## Project 2: "Movielog"
This will be a simple application to log movies I've watched. I aim to learn how to work with databases and create a user-friendly interface. Users will be able to add, edit, and delete movie entries, as well as rate and review them. I also plan to try and make it online and work with an API.
