# Projects

Projects I use to help me learn to code better. Hopefully, this will be full of stuff!

## Project 1: "Dungeon game"
This should be a cool dungeon exploring game - I hope to learn how to make random rooms, and potentially create descriptions to match. Player movement and interactions will still be limited to basic text commands for now.

For more details, see the [Project1 README](./Project1/readme.md).

## Project 2: "Movielog"
This will be a simple application to log movies I've watched. I aim to learn how to work with databases and create a user-friendly interface. Users will be able to add, edit, and delete movie entries, as well as rate and review them. I also plan to try and make it online and work with an API.
